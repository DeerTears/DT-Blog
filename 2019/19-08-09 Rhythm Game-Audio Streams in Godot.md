## Custom Audiostreams probably aren't the answer to solving latency?:

https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/development/cpp/custom_audiostreams.html

We're talking C++ Code, this doesn't reaaaaally show me how to use an audiostream in Godot's code. This is part of the FPS tutorial too, it just seems so weird that it's not better conveyed in Godot? Even this person seems to agree that it's kind of a lot to load in resources by code:

"Is it me or this way to load files is ridiculously overly complicated for such an easy access game engine? Reading comments on the internet, it seems like in Godot 2 the system was much simpler (using load() for everything) and then the devs willingly moved to this system in Godot3." - Andrea on Godot Forums

Thankfully this Reddit issue seems to be the most straightforward, GDScript answer, so I suppose I'll have to look into it more when I want to take a shot at brand new AudioStreams:

It even has a super-detailed answer in the comments! Exciting!

And because this is probably on the horizon for me, the more I dig into this, here's a good resource that I might go back to and update in its own issue.

# DT Blog

I'm Ember and this is my blog where I talk about my experiences learning to code and trying to make programs.

I'm doing this to help me make sense of things I'm making but also to avoid re-typing issues I'm having to people who are helping me. :pray:

Posts that I want to have attention drawn to will be in issues, otherwise updates will be kept as .md files in this repository under /20XX/

The year is 2008
